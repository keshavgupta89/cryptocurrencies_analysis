# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

## Overview of the Credit Risk Analysis

My friend Martha, and I, are looking to pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to her firm Accountability Accounting. We have already seen the popularity of some cryptocurrency coins, such as Bitcoin, cause a price jump that makes it unaffordable to many new investors. Martha has a data set of cryptocurrencies with alternative, and more affordable, options.  Using Marthaâ€™s dataset in cryptocurrencies, I will be using unsupervised machine learning to analyze the data and discover trends to help determine which cryptocurrencies have the highest likelihood of a major price jump. I will then display the findings using tables, and graphs to help convince her firm to invest in these new cryptocurrencies.
